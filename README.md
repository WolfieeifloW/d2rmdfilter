Welcome to my relaxed, non-strict filter! It adds Quality of Life (QoL) to the game while maintaining a very LoD-like style. This filter is very non-strict for those who are collectors or those who like to still see loot.

Filter shows all Set and Unique items!

**Latest version:** v1.5
**Installation instructions:**
In the launcher select Options -> Loot Filter. Click "+ Load New Filter" and select the file you downloaded from here or GitHub or check if the filter is already in the dropdown list.
Check this post or GitHub to ensure you have the latest version!

**Latest version:** https://discord.com/channels/897073630868013057/1408688745431040011/1414745405429780520 -> click the :arrow_down: button in the bottom-right corner "Download wolfiefilter.lua"
**GitHub link:** [WolfieeifloW/d2rmdfilter](<https://github.com/WolfieeifloW/d2rmdfilter/blob/main/wolfiefilter.lua>) -> click the :arrow_down: button in the top-right corner "Download raw file"

Some of the QoL includes:
• Reminder to pick up starting items (eg Storage Bag, Cube, etc), crafted items, tempered items, & Runewords
• Adds an ` [Eth]` tag to item name on ground
• Adds number of sockets (eg ` [2]`) tag to items on ground
• Adds superscript number to denote item tier (¹ = Normal, ² = Exceptional, ³ = Elite)

The filter hides:
• Scaling hiding of small gold piles
• After Normal difficulty, hides scrolls and low Potions
• Endgame it hides Magic items that can be gambled instead for crafting
• Endgame it hides useless bases (eg 1 socket items, non-Superior bases w/ 0 sockets, etc.)
• Endgame hides non-max socket bases
Everything else is shown!

It notifies and adds borders to good items and new RMD items:
• Notifies & adds border to new RMD items
• ...quest items
• ...essences
• ...Uber items
• ...Runes
    • Low and mid runes retain their border but stop notifying as you level up
• ...Set items
• ...Unique items
• Adds border to Rare Jewelry and Jewels
