Welcome to my relaxed, non-strict filter. My filter will add some Quality of Life (QoL) to the game while maintaining a very LoD-like style. This filter is very non-strict for those who are collectors or those who like to still see loot.

Filter shows all Set and Unique items!

Latest version: v1.0

Some of the QoL includes:
* Reminder to pick up starting items (eg Storage Bag, Cube, etc), crafted items, tempered items, & Runewords
* Adds an ` [Eth]` tag to item name on ground
* Adds number of sockets (eg ` [2]`) tag to items on ground

The only things it hides are:
* Scaling hiding of small gold piles
* After Normal difficulty, hides scrolls and low Potions
* In the endgame it hides Magic items that can be gambled instead for crafting
* In the endgame it hides useless bases (ie 1 socket items, non-Superior bases that have 0 sockets, +0 Paladin weapons)
Everything else is shown!

It notifies and adds borders to good items and new RMD items:
* Notifies & adds border to new RMD items
* Notifies & adds border to quest items
* Notifies & adds border to essences
* Notifies & adds border to Uber items
* Notifies & adds border to Runes
  * Low and mid runes retain their border but stop notifying as you level up
* Notifies & adds border to Set items
* Notifies & adds border to Unique items
* Adds border to Rare Jewelry and Jewels
